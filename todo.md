# TODO

- [ ] Create a neon theme becuase why not >:D
- [ ] Equalizer controls for audio
- [ ] Filter radio channels from music-only radios so I can sort them by their genre
- [ ] Clickup-inspired theme
- [ ] Create a React+Vite version of this but it won't be a Tampermonkey script but instead it will be an actual browser extension (or desktop app, idk how to code desktop apps but there's nothing the Internet and AI won't teach me)
- [ ] Revamp Editor to include templates and not only the update template but different templates per trigger (Will be in the browser extension)
     - This will be a "lite" version of my planned text expander browser extension called Pastepasta which creates text replacement triggers like this but using a very nerdy node-editor system. Why not? i like it when i can be creative lmao
- [ ] Look for another white noise sound because Clickup doesnt play it
- [ ] Adjust gain for ambient noise
- [ ] Create themes for: Medieval, Tarot, Space, Superhero, Candy, Anime, Vaporwave, and Winter as well as Festive themes (in the future lol)
